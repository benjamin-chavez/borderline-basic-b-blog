<p>Whats up all you cool cats and kittens!</p>

<p>
  On todays episode of Borderline Basic we have: sexual predators up for
  election, feelings of self doubt, and scrambling to find some sense of
  routine/normalcy.
</p>

<p>
  These are strange times that we are living in yall. I can’t even believe it.
  When I said that I wanted to be apart of history this is NOT what I meant! For
  many of us this is going to be one of the most pivotal points in our life
  time. This period of time will go down in history not only because of the
  pandemic, but politically as well.
</p>

<p>
  I know that I am personally struggling with several aspects of our current
  situation, and to be quite honest...I’m feeling pretty triggered. I’m angry,
  I’m scared, and I’m socially deprived.
</p>

<p>
  Let’s start with the easy stuff. Those of you who know me personally know that
  I am a social person. I don’t really have any hobbies, but thats because I
  don’t really have time for hobbies. I work over 40 hours a week while
  attending school full time during the week. When you add in homework and
  attempting to spend some time with my partner that doesn't leave much time for
  hobbies. I went from being an absurdly busy person who barely had time for a
  social life to having <strong>WAYYYYYY</strong> too much time on my hands very
  abruptly. This serious schedule change has left me reeling with boredom. I
  mean sure, I have plenty of books to read, but for some reason every time I
  sit down to read I loose all of my focus, and every time I think “Maybe I’ll
  bake something today” I can’t get up to do it. Then I bounced some ideas
  around about attempting to DIY my apartment....but then I realized...there
  isn’t much hope for improving my steadily declining apartment. So I sit here
  day in and day out trying incredibly hard to think of something that would
  give me even an ounce of fulfillment, but at the end of the day I go to bed
  with nothing to show for my rotating list of ideas. I see all of these people
  on social media who are painting with their friends, doing creative
  challenges, and leading online yoga and I think to myself “Why can’t you be as
  productive as they are? Why can’t you be as creative as they are? Why can’t
  you find a hobby”? All of the self confidence that I’ve been building over the
  last few years is rapidly declining and its all because I can’t find a hobby?
  That seems insane to me, but here I am, feeling less fulfilled than ever. So
  today I have made the decision to force myself into being productive because I
  can’t take another minute of being negative towards myself. So starting today,
  I will read for an hour a day at least, do yoga at least three times a week,
  and I will cook a big meal at least three times a week. These aren’t crazy big
  goals, but I hope that If I create a schedule for myself then I’ll get kicked
  back into productive mode and at least feel busier if not more fulfilled. Who
  knows, I might even form a healthy habit due to my efforts to enforce these
  things!
</p>

<p>
  And now for the hard stuff. I don’t talk about it often, I also don’t try to
  hide it, but I am a survivor of multiple sexual assaults. It’s an issue I
  prefer to deal with mostly in private and I usually can’t even work up the
  courage to discuss it with my therapist. It’s traumatic for me to think about
  because I repressed these memories for years and when I think about these
  experiences it feels like my brain betrayed me and like I lost a part of me
  when I repressed them. It feels almost like I didn’t live those experiences
  because when I think about them now its hard for me to accept that those
  things happened to me. In the last week, I’ve been more triggered than normal,
  I deal with things every single day that remind me of these experiences...but
  this is an entirely new level. Last week, my government told me that I have to
  choose between two “alleged” sexual predators to be my president.
</p>

<p><strong>Let that sink in for a second.</strong></p>

<p>
  I’ll repeat that for you again.
  <strong
    >My only choices for president are two people who have multiple allegations
    of sexual assault and sexual misconduct against them.</strong
  >
</p>

<p>
  I live in a country where we are telling young women and young men that its
  okay to treat and touch people how you want as long as you are in a position
  of power. This has been an underlying theme in our government for a long time,
  but now It’s blatant and I’m <strong>MAD</strong>. So what am I supposed to
  do? I want to vote. I feel like I need to vote. But my brain and my heart are
  telling me that this is not acceptable and I want no part in it. I have many
  people telling me “At least Biden is better than Trump” but to me he isn’t.
  Sure their policies are different, but are they REALLY that different of
  people? If Biden is capable of being a sexual predator than that is not the
  kind of person I want in office. One of my main arguments against Trump (not
  the only but the main) is that he has numerous accusations (and cases) of
  sexual assault. Ive spent the last four years saying how absolutely
  <strong>unbelievable</strong> it is to me that we elected a rapist as our
  president. How can I then turn around in this election and vote for Biden when
  he is accused of the same thing? What does that say about my integrity? It’s
  okay for Biden to be president and to look past his allegations but It’s not
  okay for Trump? That would make me a Hypocrite. And on another note... can you
  imagine how incredibly triggering it is for me to have to process this
  information? All I can think about is if it came down to having to choose
  between any one of the men who assaulted me and what I would do, and let me
  tell you I wouldn’t want a single one of those men to be in office! They were
  all men who were close friends at one point in time, so if I can’t look past
  what happened to me despite knowing their character outside of those events
  then how am I to be expected do it with men that I do not know? And despite
  the fact that it was neither Trump nor Biden who assaulted me, that is exactly
  what it feels like for me to be in this situation. I feel defeated. I feel
  panicked. I feel betrayed by the DNC for continuing to support Biden after
  years of being “outraged” at Trumps accusations. I feel as though my vote
  doesn’t matter. I feel hopeless and lost.
</p>

<p>
  This is a sad time not only because of the pandemic, but because of politics.
  Every day I see people fighting over party issues, instead of looking at the
  bigger picture. Our country is dealing with not one, but two viruses. Our
  government is failing us, and It’s no longer something that can be hidden.
  State governments around the country are showing signs of corruption and
  extreme carelessness for its citizens. They are using this pandemic to further
  party goals instead of caring for their people as they should be. Our media is
  a constant flow of uncertainty. We are never sure who or what to trust. Our
  world is collapsing as we know it and it saddens me to watch this happen. Our
  once great country is not even close to what it once was. I hope that this
  situation sparks change. I hope that this inspires people to take up interest
  in what they can do to make our country as great as it once was. I hope that
  my fellow humans are kind to themselves in this very trying time. I hope that
  we are all showing and giving as much love to our friends, family, and
  strangers as much as possible. I know that I need a little extra care in this
  time, as I’m sure many others do.
</p>

<p>
  Take joy in the little wins, and remember this when the time comes to make the
  choices for change yall.
</p>

<p>Until next time,</p>

<p><strong>B.</strong></p>
