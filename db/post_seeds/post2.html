  Maaaaan. Can I get a “hell yeah” from all my friends who struggle with sleep
  due to anxiety, depression, insomnia, or literally any reason that may keep
  you up at night?
</p>

<p>
  Let me tell YOU. I used the be the best sleeper in the world! Even my mom will
  tell you that I could have slept through a tornado and not have even known the
  difference, but that sweet sweet release of sleep has gone COMPLETELY down the
  drain in the last year or so.
</p>

<p>
  For some people, like my very odd boyfriend (love you!) sleep is a waste of
  time, but an unfortunate necessity. Some people would rather spend the time
  that they are sleeping working on projects or doing pretty much anything else
  aside from laying in bed.
</p>

<p>
  For people like me, sleep is an <strong>absolute necessity</strong>, and a
  much need reset. The word rest is important, because if you are like me, you
  <strong>NEED</strong> that time to allow your brain to turn off so you can
  finally get some fricken PEACE. I spend <strong>literally</strong> all day
  everyday thinking about as many things as I possibly can, and I can’t ever
  make it stop. It’s exhausting and debilitating and sometimes those 6-8
  (recommended) hours are the only thing keeping me from snapping, and I’m not
  the prettiest picture when I’m feeling overwhelmed. Additionally, like most
  people who struggle with mental health, those hours of sleep can be the
  difference in setting off an episode, or helping me keep my emotions under
  control.
</p>

<p>
  Here’s the unfortunate thing for me. I rarely get a good nights sleep anymore.
  Between my noisy roommate, the absurdly loud street at night, my boyfriend
  snoring/tossing and turning, and my never ending anxiety and rambunctious
  brain, I am left wanting to tear my hair out most mornings. Gotta love my poor
  sweet boyfriend for dealing with the hell that is me after a night of
  sleeplessness! There have even been nights where I wake up to go to the
  bathroom, come back to lay down, and I literally can’t get back to sleep
  because a song is on repeat in my head. The most recent song was basically
  just two lines from the ending scene in Grease. Can you even imagine? “<strong
    >YOU’RE THE ONE THAT I WANT YOU ARE THE ONE I WANT WOOO WOOO WOOOOOOOO
    HONEY</strong
  >” over and over and over again until I need to get up for work. I mean COME
  ON, this is the reason I can’t get back to sleep?! I suppose I have my
  Halloween costume to thank for that wonderful night.
</p>

<p>
  It’s gotten so bad that I use a white noise machine, take special melatonin
  that are instant AND extended release, as well as wear ear plugs when needed,
  and I still can’t get any damn rest. I’m basically at my wits end!
</p>

<p>
  So as I’ve put the blame on literally everything else I can think of, it
  leaves me wondering.... what is happening in my life that is causing me to be
  so restless? Is it one or all of the many reasons I’ve listed above? Or is it
  something rooted in my subconscious? Maybe it could be the culmination of
  mental health issues that have surfaced in the last couple years, or maybe
  moving apartments really would help. Lord knows I’ve had my fair share of
  surprises with my mental health this year, maybe something else is lurking in
  the shadows. Whether the issue be something tangible, or something more
  impalpable the only way to get to the root of the problem is by self
  reflection. Maybe documenting my emotions and thoughts in this blog will help.
  All I know is that I need peace.
</p>

<p>
  Wishing all of my fellow sleepless peeps the deepest most magical sleep of
  your lives tonight.
</p>

<p>Until next time,</p>

<p><strong>B.</strong></p>
